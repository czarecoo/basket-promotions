# Basket Promotion Project

## Overview
This project provides a system to apply promotions to shopping baskets. It ensures customers receive the highest applicable discount based on the contents of their basket.

## Requirements
1. **Large Purchase Promotions**: Encourage customers to make larger purchases by offering discounts on baskets that meet certain criteria.
2. **Single Discount per Basket**: Only one promotion can be applied to each basket. If multiple promotions are applicable, the one offering the highest discount will be chosen.

### Promotions (for now, will be more in the future)
1. **Fixed Discount for Minimum Basket Value**:
    - Example: €10 discount for baskets worth at least €100.
2. **Discount for Minimum Number of Items**:
    - Example: €5 discount for baskets with at least 40 items.
